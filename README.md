## Vision Statement (Moore's Template) ##
**FOR** visually impaired students in grades K-12 **WHO** struggle to participate in online class game activities, **THE** product “Tappt” is a gamified quizzing website with customized accessibility features for visually impaired students **THAT** can provide an immersive educational experience and allow educational games to be played by all students in class without sidelining students due to lack of accessibility features. **UNLIKE** existing quiz platforms like Kahoot! and GIMKIT **OUR PRODUCT** provides accessibility features for visually impaired students, such as text-to-speech for the whole classroom and a simplified control setup, where students utilize a computer’s keyboard to answer questions. After the game is over, the website also offers an overview of missed questions for studying purposes.
